# Sentient-AI-Surveillance-System-
Real-Time Emotion, Behavior &amp; Threat Detection in Public Spaces
Objective:
Design a complete AI surveillance prototype that can:

Detect and identify humans in real-time via camera input.

Analyze facial emotions (happy, angry, sad, fearful, etc.).

Monitor body posture/motion to infer behavior (e.g., running, fighting, loitering).

Flag individuals who:

Show high-risk behaviors (aggression, erratic motion)

Match known criminal profiles or appearance

Linger in sensitive zones too long (loitering, casing behavior)
